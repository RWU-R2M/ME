### Mechanics Subteam

The Mechanics Subteam is responsible for the structural design, fabrication, and assembly of the rover. Our tasks include:

- Designing the rover's chassis and suspension system to ensure durability and stability on the Martian terrain.
- Selecting and integrating mechanical components such as motors, gears, and wheels.
- Conducting stress analysis and simulations to validate the mechanical integrity of the rover.
- Collaborating with other subteams to ensure seamless integration of mechanical and electronic systems.

Our goal is to create a robust and reliable rover capable of withstanding the harsh conditions of Mars while performing scientific and exploratory tasks.

Join us in our mission to push the boundaries of space exploration and contribute to the future of interplanetary research!
